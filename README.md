### About
To work on my front-end design skills, I created a few simple websites. This website was probably too simple, I fill make something more advanced for my next project.

This app helps you convert between different colour formats such as HEX, RGB and HSL. 

While building this project, I learned about different colour formats and using CSS animations.

The app also uses VueJS.

### Installation
Initialize package manager
```
yarn
```
Run dev server
```
yarn dev-server
```

Alternatively, you can build the project.
```
yarn build
```
Then access index.html however you want. I would suggest [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for convenience.
