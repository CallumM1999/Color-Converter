### About
In an attempt to improve my front-end design skills, I have decided to create a few projects to work on my skills.
This website was probably too simple, I fill make something more advanced for my next project.

And yes, I know that I have spelled *colour* incorrectly. That is how it's spelled in CSS, I wanted to keep it consistent.

### Installation
Initialize package manager
```
yarn
```
Run dev server
```
yarn dev-server
```

Alternatively, you can build the project.
```
yarn build
```
Then access index.html however you want. I would suggest [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for convenience.
